Life with qmail
===============

Dave Sill

1. Introduction
===============

1.1. Audience
-------------

Life with qmail is aimed at everyone interested in running qmail, from
the rank amateur (newbie) who just installed Linux on a spare PC all
the way up to the experienced system administrator or mail
administrator. If you find it lacking or unclear, please let me know.
Send comments to lwq@sill.org.

There's a wealth of information available on qmail from a variety of
sources. Some is targeted to newbies, some assumes that the reader is
more experienced. Life with qmail is an attempt to "glue" this
information into a single source, filling in some of the cracks and
assuming only that the reader has basic skills such as:

o    Manipulating files/directories under UNIX

o    Operating a web browser or FTP client

o    Following directions

1.2. What is qmail?
-------------------

qmail is an Internet Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) for UNIX-like operating
systems. It's a drop-in replacement for the Sendmail system provided
with UNIX operating systems. qmail uses the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) to exchange messages with MTA's on other systems.

Note: The name is "qmail", not "Qmail".

1.3. Why use qmail?
-------------------

Your operating system included an MTA, probably Sendmail, so if you're
reading this document you're probably looking for something better.
Some of the advantages of qmail over vendor-provided MTA's include:

1.3.1. Security
---------------

qmail was designed for high security. Sendmail has a long history of
serious security problems. When Sendmail was written, the Net was a
much friendlier place. Everyone knew everyone else, and there was
little need to design and code for high security. Today's Internet is
a much more hostile environment for network servers. Sendmail's
author, Eric Allman, has done a good job of tightening up the program,
but nothing short of a redesign can achieve true security.

1.3.2. Performance
------------------

qmail parallelizes mail delivery, performing up to 20 deliveries
simultaneously, by default.

1.3.3. Reliability
------------------

Once qmail accepts a message, it guarantees that it won't be lost.
qmail also supports a new mailbox format that works reliably even over
NFS without locking.

1.3.4. Simplicity
-----------------

qmail is smaller than any other equivalently-featured MTA.

Note: The official qmail web page, http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html covers
the advantages of qmail more extensively.

1.4. History
------------

qmail was written by Dan Bernstein (DJB), http://cr.yp.to/djb.html, a
math professor now at the University of Illinois in Chicago. Dr.
Bernstein is also well known for his work in the field of cryptography
and for his lawsuit against the U.S. government regarding the
publishing of encryption source code. See
http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,36217,00.html?owv or
http://cr.yp.to/export.html for information regarding the lawsuit.

The first public release of qmail, beta version 0.70, occurred on
January, 24, 1996. The first gamma release, 0.90, was on August, 1,
1996.

Version 1.0, the first general release, was announced on February, 20,
1997. The current version, 1.03, was released on June, 15, 1998.

The next release is expected to be an evaluation version of 2.0. Some
of things that might appear in version 2 are covered at
http://cr.yp.to/qmail/future.html.

1.5. Features

1.6. Related packages
---------------------

qmail follows the classic UNIX philosophy that each tool should
perform a single, well-defined function, and complex functions should
be built by connecting a series of simple tools into a "pipeline". The
alternative is to build more and more complex tools that re-invent
much of the functionality of the simpler tools.

It's not surprising, then, that qmail itself doesn't do everything
everyone might want it to do. Here, then, are some of the most popular
add-ons written for qmail. Of course, many standard UNIX utilities can
also be plugged into qmail.

o    dot-forward--a Sendmail .forward file compatibility add-on

o    fastforward--a Sendmail alias database compatibility add-on

o    ucspi-tcp--an inetd replacement

o    daemontools--a set of tools for managing daemons and their logs

o    qmailanalog--a set of qmail log file analysis tools

o    serialmail--tools for mailing over slow networks

o    mess822--tools for parsing Internet mail messages

o    ezmlm--a mailing list manager for qmail

1.7. Architecture
-----------------

Appendix D covers qmail's functional and physical structure. In a
nutshell, qmail consists of a series of programs (modules) that
perform different tasks.

1.8. License
------------

qmail is copyrighted by the author, Dan Bernstein, and is not
distributed with a statement of user's rights. In
http://cr.yp.to/softwarelaw.html, he outlines what he thinks your
rights are under U.S. copyright law. In
http://cr.yp.to/qmail/dist.html he grants the right to distribute
qmail source code. Binary distributions are allowed under the terms
described there and in http://cr.yp.to/qmail/var-qmail.html.

The bottom line is that you can use qmail for any purpose, you can
redistribute unmodified qmail source distributions and qualifying
var-qmail binary distributions, and you can distribute patches to
qmail. You can't distribute modified qmail source code or
non-var-qmail binary distributions.

1.9. Comparison with other MTA's
--------------------------------

A book could be written about this topic, but it would be tedious
reading. Here's a quick comparison of qmail with some of the most
common UNIX MTA's.

MTA       Maturity  Security  Features  Performance Sendmailish Modular
......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ......... 
qmail     medium    high      high      high      addons    yes
Sendmail  high      low       high      low       x         no
Postfix   medium    high      medium    high      yes       yes
exim      medium    low       high      medium    yes       no
Courier   low       medium    high      medium    optional  yes

Sendmailish means the MTA behaves like Sendmail in some ways that
would make a switch from Sendmail to the alternative MTA more
user-transparent, such as the use of .forward files, /etc/aliases, and
delivery to /var/spool/mail.

Cameron Laird has a web page comparing these and other free and
commercial MTA's at
http://phaseit.net/claird/comp.mail.misc/MTA_comparison.html. Another
detailed comparison is available at
http://www.geocities.com/mailsoftware42/.

1.10. Documentation
-------------------

1.10.1. man pages
-----------------

The qmail distribution comes with a complete set of man pages. After
installation, they're in /var/qmail/man. You'll probably need to add
that directory to your MANPATH environment variable.

Shell                              Command
.................................. .................................. 
Bourne (/bin/sh)                   MANPATH=$MANPATH:/var/qmail/man;
                                   export MANPATH
bash, Korn                         export
                                   MANPATH=$MANPATH:/var/qmail/man
C Shell                            setenv MANPATH
                                   $MANPATH:/var/qmail/man

At this point, commands in the format "man name-of-qmail-man-page"
should display the appropriate man page.

The man pages are also available on-line in HTML format from:

o    http://www.qmail.org/man/index.html

Note: The qmail man pages are loaded with information, but they
require careful reading because they're written in a very dense,
technical style. You might want to print off a set and read them
through once to familiarize yourself with what's there and where it
is. Very little information is repeated on multiple pages, so if you
don't know where something is covered, it can be hard to find it.

1.10.2. Docs
------------

The qmail distribution includes a series of documents that are
installed under /var/qmail/doc. They include:

o    FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions, with answers

o    INSTALL*: Installation documentation

o    PIC.*: Descriptions of how qmail performs key tasks. See the
     Architecture appendix for more information.

o    Various other installation-related documentation

These docs are also available on-line from:

o    http://www.qmail.org/man/index.html

1.10.3. FAQs
------------

There are two official FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions, with answers)
documents:

o    /var/qmail/doc/FAQ, the plain text version, and

o    The web FAQ at http://cr.yp.to/qmail/faq.html.

The web FAQ is more complete.

1.10.5. List archives
---------------------

The qmail e-mail mailing list, maintained by Dan Bernstein, is a
valuable source of information. A web archive of the lists messages is
kept at:

o    http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/.

A search engine for the archive is at:

o    http://www-archive.ornl.gov:8000/.

Other web archives are available at:

o    http://www.egroups.com/list/djb-qmail/?refstop=1 and

o    http://msgs.securepoint.com/qmail/.

Most questions about qmail can be answered by searching the list
archives first.

1.10.6. Other Web Sites
-----------------------

o    http://cr.yp.to/qmail.html: the official qmail home page.

o    http://www.qmail.org: the unofficial qmail home page. Contains
     lots of information about add-ons and patches, and links to many
     good qmail web pages on other sites.

     HOWTO.

1.11. Support
-------------

1.11.1. Mailing lists
---------------------

The following lists reside on list.cr.yp.to. In order to prevent
harvesting of e-mail addresses by spammers, I'm avoiding the use of
complete, valid addresses and "mailto" URL's.

The lists are managed by ezmlm, which uses different addresses to
perform different functions:

o    listname@list.cr.yp.to: the submission address. Messages sent
     here go out to all members of the list. Do not send
     subscribe/unsubscribe requests here: they won't work, and they'll
     annoy the subscribers.

o    listname-help@list.cr.yp.to: the "help" address. Returns a list
     of command addresses and general usage information.

o    listname-subscribe: send a blank message here to subscribe.

o    listname-unsubscribe: send a blank message here to unsubscribe.

To specify a subscription/unsubscription address, say joe@example.com,
send the message to:

o    listname-subscribe-joe=example.com@list.cr.yp.to.

1.11.1.1. qmail
---------------

The main qmail mailing list. For discussion and questions/answers on
most things related to qmail, except those with their own lists. Read
Charles Cazabon's "12 Steps to qmail List Bliss" at
http://www.qcc.sk.ca/~charlesc/writings/12-steps-to-qmail-list-bliss.html
before posting. Also read the FAQs and search the list archives before
posting a question. When you ask questions, please try to include
sufficient details to make it possible for people to respond:

o    What did you do? What's your configuration? Include qmail-showctl
     output if you're not sure what's important. What action did you
     take? If this is a new installation, tell how you installed
     qmail.

o    What did you expect to happen? What was the outcome you were
     trying to achieve? Don't assume the reader can guess.

o    What did happen? Describe the actual result. Include log file
     clippings and copies of messages, with headers.

1.11.1.2. qmailannounce
-----------------------

The qmail announcement mailing list. New releases are announced here.
There's no submission address: it's a read-only list.

1.11.1.3. serialmail
--------------------

For discussion of the serialmail package.

1.11.1.4. ezmlm
---------------

For discussion of the ezmlm mailing list manager.

1.11.2. Consultants

support providers.

1.11.3. FAQTS Knowledgebase
---------------------------

A database of qmail-related questions and answers is available at
http://qmail.faqts.com/. If you have a question that the FAQ doesn't
answer, try searching this knowledgebase. It's especially good at
answering "how to" questions.

2. Installation
===============

This section covers installing qmail. If you're an experienced system
administrator, you can install qmail following the directions in
INSTALL in the source distribution. The INSTALL directions are the
official installation directions. They're more complex than the Life
with qmail directions, and they assume that the reader is an
experienced system and mail administrator. They're also outdated and
don't reflect Bernstein's current recommended practices.

Note: If you choose to install using the following directions, you
should read through the entire section to familiarize yourself with
the overall process.

2.1. Installation Issues
------------------------

2.1.1. Binary vs. source code
-----------------------------

Due to qmail's restrictive licensing regarding the distribution of
prebuilt packages, qmail is usually installed from a source code
distribution.

If you're not familiar with the distinction between source code and
binaries, imagine ordering a pizza delivered to your house. The
"binary" version of the pizza arrives ready-to-eat. The "source code"
pizza comes as a kit containing flour, yeast, cheese, sauce, toppings,
and directions for cooking the pizza yourself. Source code
installations are a little more work for you, but if you follow the
directions carefully, the result is the same--or even better. The
self-baked pizza will be fresher, you can adjust the toppings to your
preferences, and you'll know a lot more about your pizza and how it
"works".

Safely running an Internet-accesible network service is not easy. An
improperly configured service can put the host system at risk of
attack or can be used to attack other sites--potentially exposing the
administrator to legal liability. The more you know about how your
network services work, the more likely they are to be properly
configured and secure.

2.1.2. Tarball vs. OS-specific package
--------------------------------------

Some operating systems provide a mechanism for automating source code
installations. Returning to the pizza analogy, they make it possible
to package the ingredients and directions in such a way that you can
just push a button and have the pizza bake itself.

Sounds great, doesn't it?

In practice, it might not be such a good idea. Assembling these
packages is pretty difficult, and they might not do things the way
they're supposed to. They're software, and like any software, they can
have bugs. But even if they're bug free, the convenience they provide
comes at a cost. You lose most of the advantages of the self-baked
pizza: the ability to adjust the toppings to your personal
preferences, and the knowledge of how the pizza was made and how it
works.

If qmail was a pizza, the self-building approach might still be the
way to go. But it's not: it's a fairly complicated system that the
installer/maintainer needs to understand pretty well in order to be
able to keep it working smoothly. The self-installing qmail is easier
to install than the user-installed version, but the user-installed
version is easier to configure and troubleshoot. You install qmail
once on a system, but you will probably have several opportunities to
reconfigure it or try to figure out why mail isn't flowing the way you
think it should.

For this reason, I suggest installing qmail from scratch using the
source code tarball, not a Red Hat RPM or other self-installing
bundle.

2.2. Preparation
----------------

Before installing qmail on a system, especially if this is your first
qmail installation, there are a few things you need to think about.

o    If possible, install qmail on a "practice" system. This will give
     you a chance to make mistakes without losing important mail or
     interrupting mail service to your users.

o    If you don't have a spare, and your system is already handling
     mail using sendmail, smail, or some other MTA, you can install
     and test most pieces of qmail without interfering with the
     existing service.

o    When migrating a system from some other MTA to qmail--even if
     you've got some qmail experience under your belt--it's a good
     idea to formulate a plan.

2.3. System requirements
------------------------

qmail will install and run on most UNIX and UNIX-like systems, but
there are few requirements:

o    About 10 megabytes of free space in the build area during the
     build. After the build, you can free all but 4 megabytes by
     removing the object files.

o    A complete, functioning C development system including a
     compiler, system header files, and libraries. The build
     directions will show you how to tell if you've got the necessary
     parts.

o    A few megabytes for the binaries, documentation, and
     configuration files.

o    A safe filesystem for the queue. qmail's reliability guarantee
     requires that the queue reside on a filesystem with traditional
     BSD FFS semantics. Most modern local filesystems meet these
     requirements with one important exception: the link() system call
     is often asynchronous--meaning that the results of the link()
     operation might not have been written to disk when the link()
     call returns. Bruce Guenter's syncdir library can be used to work
     around this problem. See syncdir in the Related Packages appendix
     for more information.

o    Sufficient disk space for the queue. Small single-user systems
     only need a couple megabytes. Large servers may need a couple
     gigabytes.

o    A compatible operating system. Most flavors of UNIX are
     acceptable. See README in the source tree for a list of known
     compatible releases.

o    Access to a domain name server (DNS) is highly recommended.
     Without one, qmail can only send to remote systems configured in
     its smtproutes config file.

o    Adequate network connectivity. qmail was designed for
     well-connected systems, so you probably don't want to try to use
     it for a mailing list server on a 28.8k dial-up. The serialmail
     package was designed to make qmail more compatible with
     poorly-connected systems. See the serialmail section in the
     Related Packages appendix for more information.

2.4. Download the source
------------------------

OK, so you've got a system meeting the requirements ready for
installing qmail. The first step is to download the source code for
qmail and any other add-ons. You'll need qmail, of course, and you
should probably also get ucspi-tcp and daemontools:

o    qmail, ftp://cr.yp.to/software/qmail-1.03.tar.gz

o    ucspi-tcp, ftp://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz

o    daemontools, ftp://cr.yp.to/daemontools/daemontools-0.76.tar.gz

Retrieve these files using your web browser, web client (e.g., wget),
or FTP client.

Note: If any of the links fail, it's probably because the package has
been updated. In that case, you should go to
http://cr.yp.to/software.html and follow the links to download the
current version. It's possible that upgraded versions aren't
compatible with the following instructions, so be sure to read the
release notes in the "Upgrading from previous versions..." sections.

2.5. Build the source
---------------------

2.5.1. Verify build environment
-------------------------------

The first thing you need to do is make sure that you have the
necessary tools to compile a program. How you determine this depends
on what flavor of UNIX you're using. The easiest way to tell, although
it's not guaranteed, is to try it.

Note: If any one of these tests passes, you can stop and go on to the
next section.

o    At a command line prompt, type cc and press Enter:

    $ cc
    cc: No input files specified
    $

o    If you get a similar response, you have a C compiler in your
     path. If not, it doesn't necessarily mean you don't have one
     installed. You might, but maybe it isn't in your path. Of course
     it could also mean that you don't have one. Try these:

     o    /usr/bin/cc

     o    /usr/bin/gcc

     o    /usr/local/bin/cc

     o    /usr/local/bin/gcc

     o    /usr/ccs/bin/cc

o    If none of these works, you'll have to try something little more
     platform specific. At the prompt try one of these, depending on
     which OS you're using:

     o    Red Hat Linux: rpm -qa | grep gcc or rpm -qa | grep egcs

     o    FreeBSD: includes GCC by default

o    If you can't find a compiler installed, you'll have to locate one
     and install it. Contact your OS vendor or other OS support
     channel.

In this section we'll go through the actual steps of compiling qmail.
A way to cut-n-paste will come in handy here, but isn't really
necessary.

2.5.2. Unpack the distribution
------------------------------

If you made it this far, you have a working C compiler and copies of
the tarballs. Next, copy or move the tarballs to the directory you
want to do the work in. /usr/local/src is a good choice for qmail and
ucspi-tcp. daemontools should be built under /package.

At this time you probably want to become root, if you're not already.

    su
    umask 022
    mkdir -p /usr/local/src
    mv qmail-1.03.tar.gz ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz /usr/local/src
    mkdir -p /package
    mv daemontools-0.76.tar.gz /package
    chmod 1755 /package

Now you can unpack the packages.

    cd /usr/local/src
    gunzip qmail-1.03.tar.gz
    tar xpf qmail-1.03.tar
    gunzip ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar.gz
    tar xpf ucspi-tcp-0.88.tar
    rm *.tar    # optional, unless space is very tight
    cd /package
    gunzip daemontools-0.76.tar.gz
    tar xpf daemontools-0.76.tar
    rm *.tar    # optional, again

There should now be directories called /usr/local/src/qmail-1.03,
/usr/local/src/ucspi-tcp-0.88, and /package/admin/daemontools-0.76.

2.5.3. Create directories
-------------------------

Since qmail's installation program creates the subdirectories as
they're needed, you only need to create the qmail "home" directory:

    mkdir /var/qmail

And on to the next section.

Note: If you want some or all of the qmail files to reside elsewhere
than /var, this can be accomplished by creating symbolic links under
/var/qmail pointing to the other locations.

For example, the qmail configuration files can be stored in /etc/qmail
by doing:

    mkdir /etc/qmail
    ln -s /etc/qmail /var/qmail/control



2.5.4. Create users and groups
------------------------------

The easiest way to create the necessary users and groups is to create
a little script file to do it for you.  In the source directory you'll
find a file called  INSTALL.ids.  It contains the command lines for
many platforms, so copying the file to another name and editing that
is quick and easy.

    cd /usr/local/src/qmail-1.03
    cp INSTALL.ids IDS

Then, using your favorite editor, remove all of the file except the
lines you want.  For example, here's what IDS would look like for
FreeBSD after editing:

    pw groupadd nofiles
    pw useradd alias -g nofiles -d /var/qmail/alias -s /nonexistent
    pw useradd qmaild -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent
    pw useradd qmaill -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent
    pw useradd qmailp -g nofiles -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent
    pw groupadd qmail
    pw useradd qmailq -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent
    pw useradd qmailr -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent
    pw useradd qmails -g qmail -d /var/qmail -s /nonexistent

Then to run it, either use chmod to make it executable or run it with
sh:

First method:

    chmod 700 IDS
    ./IDS

Second method:

    /bin/sh IDS

When the script finishes, all of your users and groups will be created
and you can go on to the next section.

But what do you do if your system isn't listed in INSTALL.ids? You'll
have to create them manually.  Start by using your favorite editor and
editing /etc/group.  You need to add the following two lines to the
end of the file:

    qmail:*:2107:
    nofiles:*:2108:

Note: Make sure that 2107 and 2108 aren't already used. If they are
used, select two numbers that aren't already in use.

Next, using vipw (most systems have it, if not you'll need to use your
editor again but this time on /etc/passwd) add these lines to the end
of the file:

    alias:*:7790:2108::/var/qmail/alias:/bin/true
    qmaild:*:7791:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
    qmaill:*:7792:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
    qmailp:*:7793:2108::/var/qmail:/bin/true
    qmailq:*:7794:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true
    qmailr:*:7795:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true
    qmails:*:7796:2107::/var/qmail:/bin/true

Note: Make sure 7790-7796 aren't already in use and that 2107 and 2108
are the same group ids you used above. If any of these UID's are
already being used, select numbers that aren't already in use.

You don't specifically need to add any of these lines to the end of
the file, that's just the easiest way to explain it here.

You're now ready to continue on to the next section.

2.5.5. Do the build
-------------------

Now you can start building qmail. Change to the
/usr/local/src/qmail-1.03 directory and let's get started:

    cd /usr/local/src/qmail-1.03

In the Verify Build Environment section, you located your C compiler.
If it's not called cc or the directory it resides in isn't in your
PATH environment variable, you'll need to edit conf-cc and conf-ld.
Say your compiler is gcc, and it's in your PATH. Simply edit conf-cc
and conf-ld and replace "cc" with "gcc".

Now type the following:

    make setup check

After the build is complete, you'll need to do your post installation
configuration. A couple of scripts are provided to make this job a lot
easier.

If your DNS is configured properly, this script should be all you need
at this point:

    ./config

If, for some reason, config can't find your hostname in DNS, you'll
have to run the config-fast script:

    ./config-fast the.full.hostname

For example, if your domain is example.com and the hostname of your
computer is dolphin, your config-fast line would look like this:

    ./config-fast dolphin.example.com

Note: On a small local LAN you might want to use a pseudo domain such
as ".local". E.g., if your hostname is "mash", you could do
./config-fast mash.local. If you do this, be sure to configure qmail
to use a valid Internet domain name in return addresses. (See section
3, Configuration.)

qmail is now installed on your system and is ready to be run! The next
section will guide you through the steps of starting and testing
qmail.

2.6. Install ucspi-tcp
----------------------

Earlier, you unpacked the qmail, ucspi-tcp, and daemontools tarballs.
Now change to the ucspi-tcp directory:

    cd /usr/local/src/ucspi-tcp-0.88

In the Do the build section, if you modified conf-cc and conf-ld,
you'll need to make the same changes in this directory.

Then do:

    make
    make setup check

That's it. ucspi-tcp is installed.

2.7. Install daemontools
------------------------

Change to the daemontools build directory:

    cd /package/admin/daemontools-0.76

Once again, if you modified conf-cc and conf-ld during the qmail and
ucspi-tcp builds, you'll need to make the same changes in the src
directory.

Then do:

    package/install

On BSD systems (no /etc/inittab), you'll need to reboot at this point
to start svscan, the master service control daemon.

Use "ps -ef | grep svscan" or "ps waux | grep svscan" to verify that
svscan is running.

2.8. Start qmail
----------------

2.8.1. /var/qmail/rc
--------------------

The /var/qmail/boot directory contains example qmail boot scripts for
different configurations: /var/spool/mail vs. $HOME/Mailbox, using
procmail or dot-forward, and various combinations of these. Feel free
to examine these, but for our installation, we'll use the following
script:

#!/bin/sh

# Using stdout for logging
# Using control/defaultdelivery from qmail-local to deliver messages by default

exec env - PATH="/var/qmail/bin:$PATH" \
qmail-start "`cat /var/qmail/control/defaultdelivery`"

Note: This script uses backquotes (`), not single quotes ('). For best
results, copy and paste the scripts in this guide instead of retyping
them.

Use your editor to create the above /var/qmail/rc, then execute these
commands:

    chmod 755 /var/qmail/rc
    mkdir /var/log/qmail

At this point you need to decide the default delivery mode for
messages that aren't delivered by a .qmail file. The following table
outlines some common choices.

Mailbox       Name          Location      defaultdelivery Comments
format
............. ............. ............. ............. ............. 
mbox          Mailbox       $HOME         ./Mailbox     most common,
                                                        works with
                                                        most MUA's
maildir       Maildir       $HOME         ./Maildir/    more
                                                        reliable,
                                                        less MUA
                                                        support
mbox          username      /var/spool/mail See         traditional
                                          INSTALL.vsm   UNIX mailbox

See INSTALL.mbox, INSTALL.maildir, and INSTALL.vsm for more
information.

To select your default mailbox type, just enter the defaultdelivery
value from the table into /var/qmail/control/defaultdelivery. E.g., to
select the standard qmail Mailbox delivery, do:

    echo ./Mailbox >/var/qmail/control/defaultdelivery

Note: defaultdelivery isn't a standard qmail control file. It's a
feature of the above /var/qmail/rc file. The defaultdelivery argument
to qmail-start is the contents of a .qmail file that specifies
delivery instructions to be followed when no actual .qmail is found.
Putting these instructions in a separate control file eliminates the
need to quote shell metacharacters in the delivery instructions and
avoids messy multi-line command arguments.

2.8.2. System start-up files
----------------------------

2.8.2.1. The qmailctl script
----------------------------

If you were to manually execute the /var/qmail/rc script, qmail would
be partially started. But we want qmail started up automatically every
time the system is booted and we want it shut down cleanly when the
system is halted.

This is accomplished by creating a startup/shutdown script like the
following in /var/qmail/bin/qmailctl:

#!/bin/sh

# For Red Hat chkconfig
# chkconfig: - 80 30
# description: the qmail MTA

    fi

This script is available via
http://www.lifewithqmail.org/qmailctl-script-dt70.

Create the script using your editor or by downloading it with your web
browser (recommended).

2.8.2.1.1. rc links
-------------------

On most Linux and System V systems, you'll also need to link the
script into the init.d directory and a couple of "rc" directories. The
init.d is probably one of the following:

o    /etc/init.d

o    /sbin/init.d

o    /etc/rc.d/init.d

The rc directories are named like rcN.d, where N is the runlevel they
apply to. The intricacies of the startup directory tree are beyond the
scope of this document, so if these simplified instructions don't
suffice, consult your system documentation. Your rc directories will
probably be in one of:

o    /etc

o    /sbin

o    /etc/rc.d

To create the links, execute the following commands, replacing INITDIR
with the location of your system's init.d directory and RCDIR with the
location of your system's rc directories:

    ln -s /var/qmail/bin/qmailctl INITDIR/qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc0.d/K30qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc1.d/K30qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc2.d/S80qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc3.d/S80qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc4.d/S80qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc5.d/S80qmail
    ln -s ../init.d/qmail RCDIR/rc6.d/K30qmail

Note: The numbers in the previous step are highly system dependent,
but somewhat flexible. If Sendmail is currently installed, running the
command "find RCDIR -name "*sendmail" -print" will give you numbers
that should work for your system. Also note that the results of these
ln commands are independent of your current working directory.

On all systems, make the qmailctl script executable and link it to a
directory in your path:

    chmod 755 /var/qmail/bin/qmailctl
    ln -s /var/qmail/bin/qmailctl /usr/bin

2.8.2.2. The supervise scripts
------------------------------

Now create the supervise directories for the qmail services:

    mkdir -p /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/log
    mkdir -p /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/log

Create the /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/run file:

#!/bin/sh
exec /var/qmail/rc

Create the /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/log/run file:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog t /var/log/qmail

Create the /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/run file:

#!/bin/sh
QMAILDUID=`id -u qmaild`
NOFILESGID=`id -g qmaild`
MAXSMTPD=`cat /var/qmail/control/concurrencyincoming`
LOCAL=`head -1 /var/qmail/control/me`
if [ -z "$QMAILDUID" -o -z "$NOFILESGID" -o -z "$MAXSMTPD" -o -z "$LOCAL" ]; then
    echo QMAILDUID, NOFILESGID, MAXSMTPD, or LOCAL is unset in
    echo /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/run
    exit 1
fi
exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
    /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -l "$LOCAL" -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -c "$MAXSMTPD" \
        -u "$QMAILDUID" -g "$NOFILESGID" 0 smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1

Note: concurrencyincoming isn't a standard qmail control file. It's a
feature of the above script. Also, that's -1 (dash one) on the LOCAL
line and -l (dash ell) on the tcpserver line.

Note: Under Solaris, the normal id program won't work right in this
script. Instead of id, use /usr/xpg4/bin/id, e.g.:

    QMAILDUID=`/usr/xpg4/bin/id -u qmaild`
    NOFILESGID=`/usr/xpg4/bin/id -g qmaild`



Note: The memory limit specified in the softlimit command may need to
be raised depending upon your operating system and hardware platform.
If attempts to connect to port 25 fail, or remote systems are unable
to send you mail, try raising it to 3000000 or 4000000.

Create the concurrencyincoming control file:

    echo 20 > /var/qmail/control/concurrencyincoming
    chmod 644 /var/qmail/control/concurrencyincoming

Create the /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/log/run file:

#!/bin/sh
exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog t /var/log/qmail/smtpd

Make the run files executable:

    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/run
    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send/log/run
    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/run
    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd/log/run

Then set up the log directories:

    mkdir -p /var/log/qmail/smtpd
    chown qmaill /var/log/qmail /var/log/qmail/smtpd

Finally, link the supervise directories into /service:

    ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-send /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-smtpd /service

Note: The qmail system will start automatically shortly after these
links are created. If you don't want it running yet, do:

    qmailctl stop



2.8.2.3. SMTP Access Control
----------------------------

Allow the local host to inject mail via SMTP:

    echo '127.:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""' >>/etc/tcp.smtp
    qmailctl cdb

2.8.3. Stop and disable the installed MTA
-----------------------------------------

Although it's possible to run both qmail and your existing MTA, which
is probably Sendmail, simultaneously, I don't recommend it unless you
know what you're doing. And, frankly, if you're reading this, you
probably don't know what you're doing. :-)

If your existing MTA is Sendmail, you should be able to stop it by
running the init.d script with the "stop" argument. E.g., one of these
should work:

    /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
    /sbin/init.d/sendmail stop
    /etc/rc.d/init.d/sendmail stop

If you can't find an init.d/sendmail script, you can locate sendmail's
PID using "ps -ef|grep sendmail" or "ps waux|grep sendmail" and stop
it using:

    kill PID-of-sendmail

If your MTA isn't Sendmail, check its documentation for the correct
shutdown procedure.

You should also consider removing the old MTA completely from the
system. At least disable the init.d script so it doesn't try to start
up again when the system is rebooted.

For Red Hat Linux, removing Sendmail can be accomplished by:

    rpm -e --nodeps sendmail

Verify that nothing is listening to the SMTP port (25). Culprits could
be the old MTA, inetd, or xinetd. The following command should produce
no output (unless the qmail-smtpd service is running):

    netstat -a | grep smtp

Lastly, replace any existing /usr/lib/sendmail with the qmail version:

    mv /usr/lib/sendmail /usr/lib/sendmail.old                  # ignore errors
    mv /usr/sbin/sendmail /usr/sbin/sendmail.old                # ignore errors
    chmod 0 /usr/lib/sendmail.old /usr/sbin/sendmail.old        # ignore errors
    ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/lib
    ln -s /var/qmail/bin/sendmail /usr/sbin

Note: It's important to create the sendmail links, regardless of the
previous MTA, if any. The sendmail command is invoked by many
applications for sending mail.

The last step is to create a couple of system aliases.

2.8.4. Create System Aliases
----------------------------

There are three system aliases that should be created on all qmail
installations:

Alias                              Purpose
.................................. .................................. 
postmaster                         RFC 2821 required, points to the
                                   mail adminstrator (you)
mailer-daemon                      de facto standard recipient for
                                   some bounces
root                               redirects mail from privileged
                                   account to the system
                                   administrator

To create these aliases, decide where you want each of them to go (a
local user or a remote address) and create and populate the
appropriate .qmail files. For example, say local user dave is both the
system and mail administrator:

    echo dave > /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-root
    echo dave > /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-postmaster
    ln -s .qmail-postmaster /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-mailer-daemon
    chmod 644 /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-root /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-postmaster

See INSTALL.alias for more details.

2.8.5. Start qmail
------------------

If you stopped qmail above after creating the links in /service, you
should restart it now:

    qmailctl start

2.9. Test the Installation
--------------------------

qmail should now be running. First run qmailctl stat to verify that
the services are up and running:

    # qmailctl stat
    /service/qmail-send: up (pid 30303) 187 seconds
    /service/qmail-send/log: up (pid 30304) 187 seconds
    /service/qmail-smtpd: up (pid 30305) 187 seconds
    /service/qmail-smtpd/log: up (pid 30308) 187 seconds
    messages in queue: 0
    messages in queue but not yet preprocessed: 0

All four services should be "up" for more than a second. If they're
not, you've probably got a typo in the associated run script or you
skipped one or more steps in creating the necessary files,
direcotories, or links. Go back through the installation step-by-step
and double check your work.

It sometimes help to run a service manually in order to find
configuration problems. For example, if your qmail-smtpd/log service
isn't running, do:

    cd /service/qmail-smtpd/log
    svc -d .
    ./run
    if no errors, enter a line of text and press ENTER
    if still no errors, enter CTRL-D (end of file)

At this point, you should be able to identify the problem and fix it.
Once that's done, return to the service's directory, if necessary, and
do:

    svc -u .

Once the services are all up with >1 second uptime, follow the
instructions in TEST.deliver and TEST.receive to verify that they're
working correctly. Note that using these instructions, logging will be
accomplished by multilog to /var/log/qmail, not splogger to something
like /var/log/maillog.

3. Configuration
================

You've got qmail installed, from the recommended source tarball
method, one of the self-compiling packages, or a var-qmail package.
This section contains information you will need to configure qmail to
make it work the way you want it to.

3.1. Configuration Files
------------------------

All of qmail's system configuration files, with the exception of the
.qmail files in ~alias, reside in /var/qmail/control. The
qmail-control man page contains a table like the following:

Control           Default          Used by           Purpose

for the module listed under "Used by".

3.2. Relaying
-------------

3.2.1. Introduction
-------------------

What is relaying? It's when an MTA accepts a message via SMTP that
doesn't appear to be either for a local address or from a local
sender.

In the pre-spam days, it was common for MTA's to be configured as open
relays: promiscuous servers that would accept mail from anyone, for
anyone.

Most MTA's now are configured to either completely disable relaying,
or to only a allow certain trusted users or systems to use them as a
relay.

Chris Johnson has written a very nice document on the topic for qmail
users. I encourage you to visit
http://www.palomine.net/qmail/relaying.html.

3.2.2. Disabling relaying
-------------------------

If you follow the official directions for installing qmail, relaying
will be turned off by default. This is accomplished by populating the
file /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts with the fully-qualified domain
names listed in locals and virtualdomains (the local hosts). The name
of the control file, rcpthosts, comes from the SMTP RCPT (recipient)
command. In an SMTP session, RCPT is used to specify the addresses of
the recipients of a message. rcpthosts, then, lists the valid
hostnames that can appear in a RCPT address.

3.2.3. Allowing selective relaying
----------------------------------

Most single-user and small workgroup servers can disable relaying
completely, but if you have to support a distributed user community,
you'll need a way to allow your users, and only your users, to use
your system as a relay. This is accomplished by using tcpserver to set
the RELAYCLIENT environment variable, which tells qmail-smtpd to
override the rcpthosts file.

If you follow the installation instructions in this document,
selective relaying will be enabled by default. To give a client relay
access, add an entry to /etc/tcp.smtp like:

    IP address of client:allow,RELAYCLIENT=""

Then rebuild the SMTP access database by doing:

    qmailctl cdb

or:

    tcprules /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb /etc/tcp.smtp.tmp < /etc/tcp.smtp
    chmod 644 /etc/tcp.smtp*

If you followed the official installation instructions, Chris Johnson
has written another very nice document on how to configure qmail to
allow selected hosts to relay. See
http://www.palomine.net/qmail/selectiverelay.html.

3.3. Multiple host names
------------------------

If your system is known by more than one name, e.g., all addresses of
the form user@host1.example.com can also be written as
user@example.com or user@mail.example.com, then you need to tell qmail
this so it'll know which addresses it should deliver locally and which
messages it should accept from remote systems.

To do this, just add all of the names to two control files:

o    rcpthosts, which tells qmail-smtpd to accept mail addressed to
     these hosts, and

o    locals, which tells qmail-send that addresses on these hosts are
     to be delivered locally.

Send qmail-send a HUP (hangup) signal to tell it to reread locals. If
you have qmailctl, you can do:

    qmailctl reload

3.4. Virtual domains
--------------------

Virtual domains are similar to the multiple host names discussed in
the previous section, but there are some important differences. First,
if example.net hosts the virtual domain virtual.example.com, it's
generally not true that messages sent to joe@example.net should end up
in the same mailbox as messages sent to joe@virtual.example.com. The
namespace for each virtual domain is distinct.

With qmail, virtual domains are configured in the virtualdomains file,
which consists of one or more entries of the form:

    user@domain:prepend

qmail converts user@domain to prepend-user@domain and treats the
result as if domain was local. The user@ part is optional. If it's
omitted, the entry matches all @domain addresses.

Returning to the example scenario above, if the example.net mail
administrator wanted to create a virtual domain, virtual.example.com,
under the administrative control of user john, the following entry in
virtualdomains would accomplish that:

    virtual.example.com:john

An incoming message to joe@virtual.example.com would be rewritten as
john-joe@virtual.example.com and delivered locally. See the .qmail
section, and the extension addresses subsection for more information
about how john can manage his virtual domain.

As with multiple host names, all virtual domains must be listed in
rcpthosts so qmail-smtpd will know to accept messages addressed to
them. However, unlike multiple host names, virtual domains must not be
added to locals.

After modifying virtualdomains, send qmail-send a HUP (hangup) signal
to tell it to reread the file. If you have qmailctl, you can do:

    qmailctl reload

Don't forget to add virtual domains to rcpthosts, too.

Note: Domain name server (DNS) mail exchanger (MX) records must be set
up to direct messages for virtual domains to the appropriate mail
server. This is a job for the name server administrator and is beyond
the scope of this guide.

3.5. Aliases
------------

qmail's standard aliasing mechanism is a natural outgrowth of qmail's
local delivery mechanism. qmail-local attempts to deliver a message
addressed to localpart@host to a local user named localpart. If no
matching user is found, the message is delivered to the alias user, a
pseudo-user on all qmail systems whose home directory is usually
/var/qmail/alias.

For example, say you want to create an info@example.com alias that
forwards messages to user tom. On example.com, do, as user root:

    echo \&tom > /var/qmail/alias/.qmail-info

The .qmail section and extension addresses subsection describe how to
create .qmail files that specify which aliases exist, and what to do
with messages sent to them.

Note that because of the way aliases are implemented in qmail, an
alias can never override a valid user's deliveries. E.g., if rachel is
a normal user, ~alias/.qmail-rachel will not be used.

The fastforward package provides an alternative aliasing mechanism
that puts multiple aliases in a single file compatible with Sendmail's
alias database.

The next section, qmail-users, describes another mechanism that can be
used to implement aliases.

3.6. qmail-users
----------------

qmail-users is a system for assigning addresses to users. A series of
configuration files resides under /var/qmail/users. The assign file is
a table of assignments. There are two kinds of assignments: simple and
wildcard.

Note: assign contains a series of assignments, one per line, followed
by a line containing a single dot (.). If you create assign manually,
don't forget the dot line.

3.6.1. Simple assignment
------------------------

A simple assignment looks like:

=address:user:uid:gid:directory:dash:extension:

What this means is that messages received for address will be
delivered as user user, with the specified uid and gid, and the file
directory/.qmaildashextension will specify how the messages are to be
delivered.

3.6.2. Wildcard assignment
--------------------------

A wildcard assignment looks like:

+prefix:user:uid:gid:directory:dash:prepend:

What this means is that messages received for addresses of the form
prefixrest will be delivered as user user, with the specified uid and
gid, and the file directory/.qmaildashprependrest will specify how the
messages are to be delivered.

3.6.3. qmail-user programs
--------------------------

qmail-user has two helper programs: qmail-newu and qmail-pw2u.

qmail-newu processes the assign file and generates a constant database
(CDB) file called cdb in /var/qmail/users. CDB is a binary format that
can be accessed quickly by qmail-lspawn, even when there are thousands
of assignments.

qmail-pw2u converts the system user database, /etc/passwd, into a
series of assignments suitable for assign. qmail-pw2u uses a set of
files to modify the translation rules.

o    include: users to include

o    exclude: users to exclude

o    mailnames: alternative "mailnames" for users

o    subusers: extra addresses handled by a user, with an optional
     .qmail extension

o    append: miscellaneous assignments

Note: If you use qmail-pw2u, don't forget to re-run qmail-pw2u and
qmail-newu whenever you add users, remove users, or change UID's or
GID's. A typical sequence would be:

    qmail-pw2u </etc/passwd >/var/qmail/users/assign
    qmail-newu



3.7. Spam Control
-----------------

Chris Hardie has written an excellent qmail Anti-Spam HOWTO. It's
available from
http://www.summersault.com/chris/techno/qmail/qmail-antispam.html.

3.8. Virus Scanning
-------------------

Jason Haar has written Qmail-Scanner, a content scanning harness for
qmail. See http://qmail-scanner.sourceforge.net/ for more information.

Qmail-Scanner includes a simple built-in scanner, but serious scanning
requires a separate virus scanner--either one of the supported
commercial scanners or Tomasz Kojm's free Clam Antivirus scanner,
available from http://clamav.elektrapro.com/.

4. Usage
========

This section covers the usage of qmail by normal users. If you read or
send mail on a qmail system, this is where you'll find information
about how to do that with qmail.

4.1. .qmail files
-----------------

Delivery of a user's mail is usually controlled by one or more
".qmail" (pronounced dot kyoo mail) files--files in the user's home
directory with names beginning with .qmail. The dot-qmail man page
describes .qmail file usage.

.qmail files contain a list of delivery instructions, one instruction
per line. The first character of the line determines what kind of
delivery is involved:

Character              Delivery Type           Value
...................... ....................... ...................... 
#                      none (comment)          ignored
|                      program                 command to be run by
                                               shell
/ or .                 mbox (if last char      pathname of mbox
                       isn't a /)              (including the / or .)
/ or .                 maildir (if last char   pathname of maildir
                       is a /)                 (including the / or .)
&                      forward                 address to forward
                                               message
letter or number       forward                 address to forward
                                               message (including the
                                               first char)

4.1.1. program delivery
-----------------------

When a program delivery instruction is encountered, qmail starts a
shell (/bin/sh) to execute the command and feeds the command a copy of
the incoming message on standard input. The qmail-command man page
documents the details of this process.

Program delivery is very powerful, and can be used to implement a wide
range of functionality such as message filtering, automatically
responding to messages, and delivery via third-party delivery agents
such as procmail.

E.g.:

    |preline /usr/ucb/vacation djb

This causes qmail to start preline, pass it /usr/ucb/vacation and djb
as arguments, and provide a copy of the message on standard input.

4.1.2. mbox delivery
--------------------

Mbox is the standard UNIX mailbox format in which multiple messages
are stored in a single file and messages are headed with a "From "
line. This line looks like a header field, but it isn't one: it's just
something the delivery agent adds so mail readers can tell where each
message begins.

E.g.:

    ./Mailbox

This causes messages to be appended to $HOME/Mailbox, with a "From "
line prepended. A simple mbox mailbox with a single message looks
like:

    From user1@example.net Thu May 13 18:34:50 1999
    Received: (qmail 1287205 invoked from network); 13 May 1999 18:34:49 -0000
    From: user1@example.net
    To: user2@example.com
    Subject: hey

    What's up?

The first line was added at delivery by qmail.

4.1.3. maildir delivery
-----------------------

Maildir is a mailbox format created by Dan Bernstein to address the
shortcomings of the mbox format. A maildir mailbox is a directory
containing three subdirectories, new, cur, and tmp. Each message in a
maildir mailbox is in a separate file in one of the subdirectories,
depending upon its status: new is for unread messages, cur is for
messages that have been seen, and tmp is for messages in the process
of being delivered. The maildir man page describes the format of a
maildir in detail.

One of the benefits of the maildir format is that, even though it
doesn't use locking to prevent simultaneous updates from different
delivery agents, it's reliable. This means maildir mailboxes can
safely reside on NFS-mounted filesystems.

E.g.:

    ./Maildir/

This causes messages to be saved in $HOME/Maildir, a maildir-format
mailbox.

Note: qmail-local can deliver mail to maildir mailboxes, but it can't
create them. Maildir mailboxes should be created with the maildirmake
program that comes with qmail. E.g., "maildirmake ~/Maildir". Be sure
to run maildirmake as the owner of the maildir, not as root. Your
useradd or adduser command might support a "skeleton" directory, e.g.
/etc/skel, where you can create a maildir that will be copied for all
new users.

4.1.4. forward delivery
-----------------------

Forward deliveries causes the message to be resent to the specified
address. Addresses specified in .qmail files can't contain comment
fields or extra spaces.

These are wrong:

    &<user@example.com>
    & user@example.com
    &Joe User <user@example.com>

These are correct:

    &user@example.com
    user@example.com
    &user

The first two cause user@example.com to receive a copy of the message.
The last sends a copy to the local user user.

4.1.5. extension addresses
--------------------------

qmail supports user-controlled extension addresses. In addition to the
base address, username@hostname.domain, users can receive mail at
username-extension@hostname.domain. For the remainder of this section,
I'll leave off the "@hostname.domain" part since we're considering
actions that take place on the local system.

The delivery instructions for username-extension are in
~username/.qmail-extension.

For example, dave-lwq@sparge.example.com is controlled by
~dave/.qmail-lwq on host sparge.

Extensions can have multiple fields, e.g., dave-list-qmail, controlled
by ~dave/.qmail-list-qmail. In this example, dave-list-qmail is
subscribed to the qmail mailing list, and ~dave/.qmail-list-qmail
files the list messages in a separate mailbox.

.qmail files can be wildcarded using -default. So dave-list-qmail
could also be handled by ~dave/.qmail-list-default. This would allow
one catch-all .qmail file to handle all dave-list-whatever addresses.
Note that dave-list wouldn't be handled by ~dave/.qmail-list-default
because it doesn't match the "-" after "list".

qmail uses the closest match it finds. E.g., when a message comes in
addressed to dave-list-qmail, it'll use the first one of the following
that it finds:

    .qmail-list-qmail
    .qmail-list-default
    .qmail-default

If no matching .qmail file is found, the delivery fails and the
message bounces back to the sender.

4.2. Sending messages
---------------------

Mail users usually don't use the MTA directly to send messages.
Typically, messages are composed and sent using a Mail User Agent
(MUA) such as pine or mutt, which then calls the MTA to deliver the
message. The process of handing a message to the MTA is called
injection.

There are two ways to inject messages into most MTA's: via the Simple
Mail Transfer Protocol, SMTP, or using a program provided by the MTA
for that purpose.

4.2.1. SMTP
-----------

MUA's can open a TCP connection to port 25, the standard SMTP port, on
the local host or a designated mail server. The MUA and the MTA then
engage in a dialogue that results in either:

o    the message being transfered to the MTA, or

o    a error status being returned to the MUA

SMTP has no mechanism for authentication, so no username or password
is required to send a message. However, many MTA's refuse to accept
messages that don't appear to be either from or for a local user. If a
properly formatted message is rejected, relaying restrictions are the
most likely cause. See the Relaying section for more information about
relay configuration.

4.2.2. /var/qmail/bin/sendmail
------------------------------

For many years, Sendmail was the UNIX MTA. It was so ubiquitous, that
many programmers just assumed that it was the MTA. As a result,
Sendmail's local injection mechanism became the standard Application
Programmer's Interface (API) for local mail injection. qmail and other
non-Sendmail MTA's provide a sendmail program that works the same way
as the real Sendmail's sendmail for local injection.

The qmail sendmail, which is normally in /var/qmail/bin/sendmail,
usually replaces the Sendmail sendmail on qmail systems. Typical
locations of the sendmail program include:

o    /usr/lib/sendmail

o    /usr/sbin/sendmail

On a qmail system, "ls -l path-to-sendmail" should show that sendmail
is a symbolic link to /var/qmail/bin/sendmail:

  $ ls -l /usr/lib/sendmail
  lrwxrwxrwx   1 root     root           29 Feb 19 11:04 /usr/lib/sendmail -> /var/qmail/bin/sendmail

The sendmail man page provided with qmail describes how to use the
program.

4.2.3. qmail-inject
-------------------

In addition to emulating the sendmail API, qmail has its own injection
program: qmail-inject. In fact, sendmail is just a wrapper around
qmail-inject.

As an API, sendmail is probably better because it's much more widely
available. The qmail API provided by qmail-inject will only work on
systems with qmail, but the sendmail interface is nearly universal.

For example, to send a blank message to joe@example.com:

 echo To: joe@example.com | /var/qmail/bin/qmail-inject

4.3. Environment Variables
--------------------------

Some qmail programs set or use environment variables. The following
table lists these variables and describes their use.

5. Advanced Topics
==================

5.1. procmail
-------------

procmail is a popular Message Delivery Agent (MDA). The function of an
MDA is to accept a message from the MTA for a specific user or
mailbox, and deliver the message according to the user's desires.
procmail can be used to "filter" messages by the content of various
header fields or the body of the message. For example, messages from a
particular person can be directed to a mailbox for just that person.

There are a couple tricks to running procmail with qmail. First,
procmail is usually built to deliver to an mbox mailbox in
/var/spool/mail. You can rebuild procmail to default to $HOME or you
can instruct users not to rely on procmail to default the location of
the mbox. Unless you patch it for $HOME delivery, procmail will still
use /var/spool/mail for temporary files.

Another problem is that qmail-command and procmail don't have a common
understanding of which exit codes mean what. procmail uses the
standard UNIX exit codes: zero means success, nonzero means failure,
and the cause of the failure is indicated by /usr/include/sys/errno.h.
qmail-command uses certain nonzero codes to indicate permanent errors
and the rest are considered temporary. A small shell script wrapper
can be used to translate the exit codes for qmail-command. Such a
wrapper was posted to the qmail list and is available from the
archives at
http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/1998/04/msg00487.html.

Also, older versions of procmail (prior to 3.14) don't deliver
directly to maildir-format mailboxes. Your best bet is to upgrade to
the current version of procmail. Another approach is safecat, a
program that writes a message on standard input to a specified
maildir. Users can write procmail recipes (delivery instructions) that
use safecat to file the message. You can also skip procmail
altogether, and use maildrop.

Finally, procmail expects the messages it receives to be in mbox
format. Normal qmail program deliveries include only the actual mail
message, not including a "From " line. The preline command can be used
to format the message as procmail expects. The wrapper linked above
includes preline.

For example, let's say user "dave" wants his mail to be processed by
procmail. His system administrator has built procmail to deliver to
$HOME by default, and has provided the exit code wrapper linked above,
called /usr/local/bin/qmail-procmail. His .qmail file should look
like:

    |/usr/local/bin/qmail-procmail

5.2. POP and IMAP servers
-------------------------

qmail includes a POP server, qmail-pop3d, but it's not configured and
installed as part of the qmail installation process. You can also use
one of the other POP or IMAP servers available, although most of them
were written for Sendmail and will require some work to use with
qmail.

5.2.1. qmail-pop3d
------------------

qmail-pop3d is the POP server included with qmail. It's a fine POP
server, and many qmail sites use it. It's modular, and supports
multiple authentication schemes via alternative authentication
modules.

Note: qmail-pop3d supports only maildir-format mailboxes, so if you
have users logging into the POP server and running MUA's locally, they
all have to support maildir. If all of your users read mail via POP,
the mailbox format on the server is not an issue.

5.2.1.1. Architecture of qmail-pop3d
------------------------------------

A qmail-pop3d server consists of three modules:

o    qmail-popup--gets username/password

o    checkpassword--authenticates username/password

o    qmail-pop3d--the POP daemon

Typically, qmail-popup is run via inetd or tcpserver, listening to
port 110, the POP3 port. When a connection is made, it prompts for the
username and password. Then it invokes checkpassword, which verifies
the username/password and invokes qmail-pop3d if they match.

5.2.1.2. Installation of qmail-pop3d
------------------------------------

1. Completely install and test qmail. If you want all users to have
POPable mailboxes, make sure defaultdelivery is set to ./Maildir/. If
you installed the /var/qmail/rc script from the Installation section,
this is configured in control/defaultdelivery. If not, it's probably
in /var/qmail/rc on the qmail-start command line.

2. Download a checkpassword program from
http://www.qmail.org/top.html#checkpassword. The standard
checkpassword, http://cr.yp.to/checkpwd.html, is a good choice if you
don't need anything fancy.

3. Compile and install checkpassword according to the directions. Make
sure you install it as /bin/checkpassword.

4. Create a /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d/run script containing:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
        /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -H -l 0 0 110 /var/qmail/bin/qmail-popup \
            FQDN /bin/checkpassword /var/qmail/bin/qmail-pop3d Maildir 2>&1

where FQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the POP server you're
setting up, e.g., pop.example.net.

5. Create a /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d/log/run script
containing:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec /usr/local/bin/setuidgid qmaill /usr/local/bin/multilog t \
        /var/log/qmail/pop3d

6. Set up the log directory and permissions on the run scripts, and
link the service into /service:

    chmod +t /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d   # if daemontools < 0.75
    mkdir /var/log/qmail/pop3d
    chown qmaill /var/log/qmail/pop3d
    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d/run
    chmod 755 /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d/log/run
    ln -s /var/qmail/supervise/qmail-pop3d /service

7. Add the following to qmailctl's "start" section:

    if svok /service/qmail-pop3d ; then
      svc -u /service/qmail-pop3d
    else
      echo qmail-pop3d supervise not running
    fi

8. Add the following to qmailctl's "stop" section:

    echo "  qmail-pop3d"
    svc -d /service/qmail-pop3d

9. Add the following to qmailctl's "stat" section:

    svstat /service/qmail-pop3d
    svstat /service/qmail-pop3d/log

10. Add the following to qmailctl's "pause" section:

    echo "Pausing qmail-pop3d"
    svc -p /service/qmail-pop3d

11. Add the following to qmailctl's "cont" section:

    echo "Continuing qmail-pop3d"
    svc -c /service/qmail-pop3d

12. Add the following to qmailctl's "restart" section:

    echo "* Restarting qmail-pop3d."
    svc -t /service/qmail-pop3d

5.2.2. Qpopper
--------------

If you need a POP daemon that works with mbox-format mailboxes, you
can use Qualcomm's Qpopper. Qpopper is available from
http://www.eudora.com/qpopper_general/.

5.2.3. SolidPOP
---------------

The SolidPOP POP3 server supports both maildir and mbox mailboxes.
It's available from http://solidpop3d.pld.org.pl/.

5.2.4. imap-maildir
-------------------

David R. Harris has cleaned up the patch that adds maildir support to
the University of Washington IMAP server and documented the
installation process. See http://www.davideous.com/imap-maildir/.

5.2.5. Courier-IMAP
-------------------

Sam Varshavchik has written an IMAP server that supports maildir
mailboxes only. It's available from
http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/.

5.3. POP and IMAP clients
-------------------------

5.3.1. fetchmail
----------------

fetchmail is a program that retrieves mail from a POP or IMAP server
and re-injects it locally. fetchmail has no trouble retrieving mail
from qmail servers, but there are a couple tricks for making it work
well on a qmail client.

Here's a sample .fetchmailrc for a user on a qmail system:

poll mail.example.net proto pop3 nodns
    user dsill with password flubgart is dave here
    fetchall forcecr to * here

This instructs fetchmail to connect to mail.example.net via POP3, log
in as user dsill, password flubgart, retrieve all messages, and
deliver them to dave@localhost. The forcecr causes fetchmail to end
each line with a carriage return when injecting the message on the
local system via SMTP. qmail requires this.

5.3.2. getmail
--------------

getmail is a program that retrieves mail from a POP server and
delivers it to a maildir mailbox. It's actually a Python script, so
you may need to install the Python interpreter before you can use
getmail

getmail was written by Charles Cazabon, who maintains a web page for
it at
http://www.qcc.sk.ca/~charlesc/software/getmail-2.0/getmail.html.

5.4. Multi-RCPT vs. Single RCPT delivery
----------------------------------------

Say you're an MTA, and one of your users sends a message to three
people on hostx.example.com. There are several ways you could do this.

1.   You could open an SMTP connection to hostx, send a copy of the
     message to the first user, send a copy to the second user, send a
     copy to the third user, then close the connection.

2.   You could start three processes, each of which opens an SMTP
     connection to hostx, sends a copy of the message to one of the
     users, then closes the connection.

3.   You could open an SMTP connection to host, send a copy of the
     message addressed to all three users, then close the connection.

The first method is clearly inferior to the third. Even if the message
is tiny, it'll take at least as long. And if the message is large,
it'll take a lot longer and use more network bandwidth.

So scratch that one.

The second and third methods are a little more interesting.

The third method only opens one connection to hostx, and only sends
one copy of the message. That makes for efficient use of bandwidth.

The second method uses multiple connections and sends multiple copies
of the message. That "wastes" bandwidth, but due to the nature of the
SMTP protocol, requires fewer round-trip delays, and is faster than
the third method. It's also simpler than the third method, so the MTA
can be coded in a more straightforward manner. And finally, because
each recipient gets their own copy of the message, it's possible for
the MTA to implement VERPs (see next section).

qmail always uses the second method (single RCPT). There are no
patches to implement the third method (multiple RCPT)--it would
require major work.

Although there are pathological cases where it can be slower than
multiple RCPT, the simplicity and VERP advantages outweigh that
overall.

Single RCPT delivery does use more bandwidth than multiple RCPT
delivery, but the difference is often exaggerated. Most messages have,
at most, a couple recipients, and they're usually on separate hosts,
so multi-RCPT delivery buys them nothing. Even on a list server, where
multi-RCPT delivery could help, the potential gains are small because
SMTP uses only a fraction of the bandwidth over most links--HTTP
usually gets the lion's share.

For example, if 10% of your uplink's bandwidth goes to SMTP, and your
SMTP bandwidth could be reduced by, say, 25%, by using multi-RCPT
delivery, that would only drop your SMTP bandwidth to 7.5%.

5.5. VERP
---------

When a message is undeliverable, the MTA responsiblle is supposed to
return a bounce message to the envelope return path (ERP). The bounce
message should include the address of the recipient, the reason the
message is undeliverable, and whether the problem is temporary or
permanent. Some MTA's don't do the right thing, though. They might
send the bounce to the address in the From header field, or the bounce
might not identify the recipient.

For most user-to-user messages, these problems aren't too bad. One can
usually figure things out based on the timing of the bounce or the
contents. For mailing lists, the problem of bad bounces is more
serious. Subscribers move, forwarding mail to their new address. If
the new address starts having delivery problems, it can be impossible
to tell which subscriber's mail is bouncing if the bounce message only
includes the new address.

Dan Bernstein came up with a solution to this problems called VERP
(Variable Envelope Return Path). Using VERPs, each message sent to
each subscriber to a list has a unique return path. This allows a
bounce handler to identify the problem subscriber.

For example, a typical non-VERP'ed mailing list has a return address
of the form listname-owner@domain. For a VERP'ed list, the return
address would look like listname-owner-subscriber=sdomain@ldomain,
where the subscriber's address, subscriber@sdomain, is embedded
between the "owner" and the "@". (The "@" in the subscriber's address
is replaced with an "=".)

The ezmlm list manager uses VERPs to automatically handle bounces. It
even provides subscribers with temporary delivery problems with a list
of the messages they missed so they can retrieve them from the
archive.

Russell Nelson wrote a bounce manager for Majordomo under qmail, but
he no longer maintains it. It's available from
http://www.qmail.org/bounceman-0.4.shar.

5.6. Troubleshooting
--------------------

5.6.1. Processes
----------------

A properly-running, complete, but minimal qmail installation should
always have the following four processes:

o    qmail-send running as user qmails

o    qmail-clean running as user qmailq

o    qmail-rspawn running as user qmailr

o    qmail-lspawn running as user root

Depending upon your flavor of UNIX, one of the following two commands
should list these processes, and possibly a few more:

    ps -ef | grep qmail
    ps waux | grep qmail

For example:

[dave@sparge dave]$ ps waux|grep qmail
dave      2222  0.0  0.8   836   348  p4 S    10:25   0:00 grep qmail
qmaild     351  0.0  1.0   840   400  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -u 49491 -g 31314 0 smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd-
qmaild    2220  0.0  1.0   844   420  ?  S N  10:25   0:00 /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -u 49491 -g 31314 0 smtp /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd-
qmaill     365  0.0  0.8   748   344  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 splogger qmail
qmailq     368  0.0  0.7   736   292  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 qmail-clean
qmailr     367  0.0  0.6   732   272  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 qmail-rspawn
qmails     350  0.0  0.8   776   336  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 qmail-send
root       340  0.0  0.6   724   252  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 /usr/local/sbin/supervise /var/supervise/qmail-send /var/qmail/rc
root       341  0.0  0.6   724   252  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 /usr/local/sbin/supervise /var/supervise/tcpserver-qmail /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -x /etc/tcp.smtp
root       366  0.0  0.7   736   276  ?  S N  12:43   0:00 qmail-lspawn ./Mailbox
[dave@sparge dave]$

If you run qmail or qmail-smtpd under supervise, as in the example
above, you should see those processes as well. And if run qmail-smtpd
under tcpserver, you should see a parent tcpserver process plus an
additional tcpserver process for each active incoming SMTP connection.

If you use splogger (or multilog or cyclog) to handle logging, you'll
have a splogger (or multilog or cyclog) process or two running as user
qmaill.

Also, if qmail is busy delivering messages locally or remotely, you'll
see up to concurrencylocal qmail-local processes and up to
concurrencyremote qmail-remote processes.

5.6.2. Logs
-----------

5.6.2.1. multilog
-----------------

multilog, which is part of the daemontools package, logs messages to a
series of files in a specified directory.

The log directory is specified on the multilog command line, so you
can find it by examining your qmail startup scripts.

The number of files in the log directory, and the maximum size of each
file, are determined by multilog options. The log file names are the
TAI (Temps Atomique International) timestamps of the time at which the
file was started. The tai64nlocal command, also from daemontools,
converts TAI timestamps into local, human-readable timestamps.

A typical multilog log entry looks like:

@4000000038c3eeb104a6ecf4 delivery 153: success: did_1+0+0/

"@4000000038c3eeb104a6ecf4" is the optional, but recommended, TAI
timestamp. "delivery 153: success: did_1+0+0/" is the log message
itself.

5.6.2.2. splogger
-----------------

splogger uses the syslog logging system to timestamp messages and send
them to the syslog daemon. Syslog is configured in /etc/syslog.conf.
Messages sent to syslog have a facility and priority. Entries in
/etc/syslog.conf filter on the facility and priority to direct the
messages to the desired log file, remote log host, or the console.
splogger logs to the mail facility, by default, so grep'ing the
syslog.conf file for "mail" should show the disposition of qmail's log
messages.

Typical locations include:

o    /var/log/syslog

o    /var/adm/SYSLOG

o    /var/log/maillog

A typical syslog log entry looks like:

Jun  3 11:35:23 sparge qmail: 928424123.963558 delivery 153: success: did_1+0+0/

"Jun  3 11:35:23" is the syslog timestamp.

"sparge" is the name of the system that sent the message.

"qmail:" is the tag splogger places on all qmail log entries.

"928424123.963558" is an optional TAI timestamp (see next section).

"delivery 153: success: did_1+0+0/" is the log message itself.

5.6.2.3. Log messages
---------------------

Here's a typical log sequence for a message sent to a remote system
from the local system:

1 @4000000038c3eeb027f41c7c new msg 93869
2 @4000000038c3eeb027f6b0a4 info msg 93869: bytes 2343 from <dave@sill.org> qp 18695 uid 49491
3 @4000000038c3eeb02877ee94 starting delivery 2392: msg 93869 to remote lwq@w3.to
4 @4000000038c3eeb0287b55ac status: local 0/10 remote 1/20
5 @4000000038c3eeb104a13804 delivery 2392: success: 209.85.127.177_accepted_message.
   /Remote_host_said:_250_CAA01516_Message_accepted_for_delivery/
6 @4000000038c3eeb104a4492c status: local 0/10 remote 0/20
7 @4000000038c3eeb104a6ecf4 end msg 93869

Line 1 indicates that qmail has received a new message, and its queue
ID is 93869. The queue ID is the i-node number of the
/var/qmail/queue/mess/NN/ file--the queue file that contains the
message. The queue ID is guaranteed to be unique as long as the
message remains in the queue.

Line 2 says that the message is from dave@sill.org and is 2343 bytes.

Line 3 says qmail-remote is starting to deliver the message to
lwq@w3.to, and it's assigning the ID 2392 to the delivery.

Line 4 says 0 local deliveries and 1 remote delivery are pending.

Line 5 says delivery 2392 is complete and successful, and it returns
the remote server's response, which often contains information the
remote mail administrator would find helpful in tracking a delivery.
In this case, the "CAA01516" is the remote system's delivery ID.

Line 6 says 0 local deliveries and 0 remote deliveries are pending,
i.e., the delivery is complete.

Line 7 says that the message has been delivered completely and removed
from the queue. At this point, the queue ID, 93869, is reusable for
another delivery.

5.7. Big Servers
----------------

See also qmail-ldap.

5.7.1. Scalable parallelism
---------------------------

Use a fast NFS network file server to store user directories. Set up
multiple equal-preference SMTP servers delivering to maildir mailboxes
on the file server.

5.8. Migrating from Sendmail to qmail
-------------------------------------

Check Dan Bernstein's Sendmail->qmail page at
http://cr.yp.to/qmail/sendmail.html.

5.9. Mailing List Managers
--------------------------

Mailing list managers (MLM's) are systems that help list owners run
mailing lists. Their duties fall into two main divisions: managing the
lists of subscribers, and controlling the resending of messages to the
subscribers.

Most (all?) UNIX mailing list managers can be made to work with qmail.

5.9.1. ezmlm
------------

ezmlm was written by Dan Bernstein, the author of qmail. It was
written for use with qmail, and relies on several features of qmail.
Most notably, it uses VERPs to reliably process bounce messages. ezmlm
is somewhat unique among MLM's in that it doesn't process commands
sent to a central MLM address: it appends the command to the name of
the list. E.g., to subscribe to the "foo@list.example.net" list, one
sends a message to "foo-subscribe@list.example.net".

For more information about ezmlm, see http://www.ezmlm.org/, the
unofficial ezmlm web site, and the official home of ezmlm-idx, a very
nice add-on that includes many useful features.

5.9.2. Majordomo
----------------

Majordomo is one of the most popular UNIX MLMs. It works fine with
qmail provided a few simple changes are made. Russ Allbery has written
a FAQ about qmail/Majordomo available from
http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/faqs/mjqmail.html.

5.10. Patches
-------------

Various source code patches are available for qmail. To install a
patch, download it, cd to the qmail source tree, and apply it using
the patch command.

    cd /usr/local/src/qmail/qmail-1.03
    patch -p0 </tmp/patchfile

Stop qmail by killing qmail-send or, if you installed the qmailctl
script in the Installation section, do:

    qmailctl stop

Then rebuild and install the new binaries:

    make setup check

And restart qmail:

    qmailctl start

Finally, test qmail--especially the part you patched.

Note: Although http://www.qmail.org/ lists many patches for qmail,
none of the them have been approved by the author of qmail. They may
introduce security, reliability, efficiency, or functionality problems
not present in qmail. Most qmail installations don't require the use
of any patches whatsoever. You should not install any patches that you
don't clearly require.



5.10.1. DNS
-----------

Historically, DNS responses have been limited to 512 bytes. Some large
sites have started returning MX responses longer than that. qmail and
many other programs have a problem with Domain Name Server (DNS)
queries that return very large results. There are three ways to fix
this in qmail.

5.10.1.1. Run dnscache from djbdns
----------------------------------

dnscache is, as the name implies, a caching DNS server. It knows how
to handle large DNS responses and generally improves DNS lookup
performance for all services that use DNS. Because it doesn't require
patching qmail, this is by far the best solution. See the djbdns
section under Related Packages for more information.

5.10.1.2. Bump the packet buffer size up to 65536
-------------------------------------------------

Works with recent BIND resolver libraries, which will automatically do
a TCP query within the library code if the reply comes back with the
truncation bit set. This is the simplest fix, though it's also
potentially the most wasteful of memory, depending on how your system
handles paging. To do this, just replace PACKETSZ with 65536 in dns.c
and rebuild qmail.

5.10.1.3. Christopher K. Davis' patch, http://www.ckdhr.com/ckd/qmail-103.patch
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an adaptation of a patch by Chuck Foster's which should work
with any resolver library, no matter how old, and uses a guard byte to
avoid the "number of bytes placed in the buffer" library bug. It
reallocates only once, to 65536, rather than just to the size needed,
so it can be less memory-efficient than Chuck's patch (though, like
his patch, it only reallocates if the response is larger than
PACKETSZ, which defaults to 512 bytes). After reallocating, it forces
a TCP query, rather than requiring the resolver library to do so
(avoiding an extra round-trip between qmail and the name server,
though if they're on the same machine or local network this is not a
big worry).

5.10.2. qmail-ldap
------------------

This patch, by Andre Oppermann, et al, implements Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) support in qmail. LDAP is like a
network phone book. Using qmail-ldap, it should be possible for a POP
server to serve many thousands of users. See http://www.nrg4u.com/.

5.11. QMTP
----------

QMTP is the Quick Mail Transfer Protocol, an SMTP replacement protocol
designed by Dan Bernstein. The protocol is defined at
http://cr.yp.to/proto/qmtp.txt. QMTP is similar to SMTP, but is
simpler, faster, and incompatible with SMTP. qmail includes a QMTP
server, qmail-qmtp, which is run very much like qmail-smtp. QMTP
usually uses port 209.

qmail doesn't include a QMTP client, but the serialmail package does.
maildirqmtp takes a maildir mailbox and delivers the messages it
contains to designated QMTP server via QMTP.

QMTP is not a drop-in replacement for SMTP, and is not yet in
widespread use across the Internet.

Russ Nelson has a patch for qmail-remote that supports QMTP. It's
available from http://www.qmail.org/qmail-1.03-qmtpc.patch. He also
has a tarball that can be extracted in /service to enable a QMTP
service. It's available from
http://www.qmail.org/qmtpd-service.tar.gz.

A. Acknowledgments

Nelson deserves special mention as one of the most helpful, patient,
knowledgeable, and funny contributors. His contributions to the qmail
community are second only to DJB's.

Special thanks to Henning Brauer for donating the lifewithqmail.org
domain and hosting it!

Life with qmail was written using Simple Document Format (SDF), a very
cool Perl-based markup language that generates HTML, plain text,
PostScript, POD, and other formats. It made the job much easier. See
http://search.cpan.org/author/IANC/sdf-2.001/ for more information.

B. Related Packages
===================

B.1. dot-forward
----------------

Sendmail uses .forward files, pronounced dot forward, to allow users
to control the delivery of messages they receive. qmail uses a similar
mechanism: .qmail files. The dot-forward package gives qmail the
ability to use .forward files. Systems running Sendmail or any other
MTA that uses .forward files might want to consider using dot-forward
to avoid having to convert existing .forward files to their .qmail
equivalents--or simply to make the transition to qmail less visible to
their users.

dot-forward is a small package: easy to install and configure. The
source is available from
ftp://cr.yp.to/software/dot-forward-0.71.tar.gz.

dot-forward was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for
it at http://cr.yp.to/dot-forward.html.

B.2. fastforward
----------------

fastforward is another Sendmail compatibility add-on. Sendmail uses a
central alias database kept in a single file, usually /etc/aliases.
qmail uses a series of dot-qmail files in /var/qmail/alias, one file
per alias. If you're migrating to qmail, and you've got a
Sendmail-format aliases file you don't want to convert, fastforward
gives qmail the ability to use the aliases file as-is.

The source is available from
ftp://cr.yp.to/software/fastforward-0.51.tar.gz.

fastforward was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for
it at http://cr.yp.to/fastforward.html.

B.3. ucspi-tcp
--------------

qmail's SMTP server doesn't run as a stand alone daemon. A helper
program such as inetd, xinetd, or tcpserver runs as a daemon. When it
receives a TCP connection to port 25, the SMTP port, it executes a
copy of qmail-smtpd.

Inetd is the standard network server "super-server". It can be
configured through /etc/inetd.conf to run qmail-smtpd, but the
recommended tool is tcpserver, which is part of the ucspi-tcp package.
ucspi-tcp is an acronym for UNIX Client-Server Program Interface for
TCP, and it's pronounced ooks-pie tee see pee.

tcpserver is preferred over inetd because:

o    tcpserver allows one to limit the number of simultaneous
     connections to a service. Inetd has a connection-rate limiting
     mechanism that temporarily disables services that are "too" busy.

o    tcpserver can be configured to deny access to certain hosts or to
     recognize local hosts and flag them so qmail-smtpd can treat them
     differently.

o    tcpserver is the only server supported by the author of qmail.

The source is available from

it at http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html.

B.4. daemontools
----------------

The daemontools package contains a set of utilities for controlling
and monitoring services. It's not mandatory, but it's highly
recommended, especially for busy systems. It includes:

o    supervise, which monitors a service and restarts it if it dies.

o    svc, which talks to supervise and allows one to stop, pause, or
     restart the service.

o    multilog, which maintains a log for a service, automatically
     rotating it to keep it under the configured size.

o    setuidgid, which runs programs for the superuser with a normal
     user's UID and GID.

The source for daemontools is available from:

B.5. qmailanalog
----------------

qmailanalog processes qmail's log file and produces a series of
reports that tell one how much and what kind of work the system is
doing. If you need statistics about how many messages are being sent
or received, how big they are, and how quickly they're being
processed, qmailanalog is what you need.

As a bonus, the matchup program combines qmail's multiple log lines
per delivery into one--not unlike the familiar Sendmail logs.

The source for qmailanalog is available from
http://cr.yp.to/software/qmailanalog-0.70.tar.gz.

qmailanalog was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for
it at http://cr.yp.to/qmailanalog.html.

Note: qmailanalog relies on log entry timestamps in the fractional
second format used by accustamp. In order to use it with logs
generated by multilog, which are in TAI64N format, you'll need to
translate them into the old format. One program to do that is
available from http://www.qmail.org/tai64nfrac.

B.6. rblsmtpd
-------------

If you've never been spammed, consider yourself very lucky. Most
e-mail users are all too familiar with Unsolicited Bulk E-mail (UBE),
aka "spam". Most of it is advertisements for sex sites, chain letters,
and other scams. Back in the days of old, up until around 1998 or so,
most MTA's on the Internet were open relays, i.e., they would accept
mail from anyone for anyone, even if neither sender nor recipient was
local. Spammers use open relays, if they can find any, to deliver
their spam. It covers their tracks, redirects the backlash toward the
"innocent" relay site, and saves them lots of CPU time and network
bandwidth.

Such open relays are considered very bad form these days, and several
anti-spam vigilante groups have created a mechanism for identifying
open relays and other common sources of spam so they can avoid
accepting SMTP connections from them.

rblsmtpd is an RBL SMTP Daemon. It sits between tcpserver and
qmail-smtpd and rejects connections from systems identified on one of
these lists.

For example, to run rblsmtpd under tcpserver, try something like:

    #!/bin/sh
    QMAILDUID=`id -u qmaild`
    NOFILESGID=`id -g qmaild`
    MAXSMTPD=`cat /var/qmail/control/concurrencyincoming`
    exec /usr/local/bin/softlimit -m 2000000 \
    /usr/local/bin/tcpserver -v -R -H -l 0 -x /etc/tcp.smtp.cdb -c "$MAXSMTPD" \
        -u "$QMAILDUID" -g "$NOFILESGID" 0 smtp /usr/local/bin/rblsmtpd\
        -r relays.ordb.org /var/qmail/bin/qmail-smtpd 2>&1

rblsmtpd was previously available as a separate utility, but is now
bundled with ucspi-tcp.

rblsmtpd was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for it
at http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/rblsmtpd.html.

B.7. serialmail
---------------

qmail was designed for systems with full time, high speed
connectivity. serialmail is a set of tools that make qmail better
suited to intermittent, low speed connectivity. With serialmail on
such a system, qmail is configured to deliver all remote mail to a
single maildir. The serialmail maildirsmtp command is used to upload
the maildir to the ISP's mail hub when the connection is brought up.
If the ISP supports QMTP (see QMTP under Advanced Topics), maildirqmtp
can also be used.

serialmail can be used on the ISP side of the connection to implement
AutoTURN: an SMTP connection by a client causes the server to initiate
a connection back to the client for sending messages queued on the
server for the client. This is similar to the ETRN SMTP function.

The source for serialmail is available from
http://cr.yp.to/software/serialmail-0.75.tar.gz.

serialmail was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for
it at http://cr.yp.to/serialmail.html.

B.8. mess822
------------

mess822 is a library and set of applications for parsing RFC 822
compliant mail messages. The applications include:

o    ofmipd: a daemon that accepts messages from clients and rewrites
     From fields based on a database.

o    new-inject: a qmail-inject replacement that supports
     user-controlled hostname rewriting.

o    iftocc: a .qmail utility for checking whether a message was sent
     to a specific address.

o    822header, 822field, 822date, and 822received: extract
     information from a message.

o    822print: pretty-prints a message.

The source for mess822 is available from
http://cr.yp.to/software/mess822-0.58.tar.gz.

mess822 was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for it
at http://cr.yp.to/mess822.html.

B.9. ezmlm
----------

ezmlm is a high performance, easy-to-use mailing list manager (MLM)
for qmail. If you're familiar with LISTSERV or Majordomo, you know
what a mailing list manager does. For more information about mailing
lists under qmail see Mailing List Managers under Advanced Topics.

The source for ezmlm is available from
http://cr.yp.to/software/ezmlm-0.53.tar.gz.

ezmlm was written by Dan Bernstein, who maintains a web page for it at
http://cr.yp.to/ezmlm.html.

Fred Lindberg and Fred B. Ringel have developed an extension to ezmlm
called ezmlm-idx. It adds lots of useful features and is highly
recommended. It's available from http://www.ezmlm.org/.

B.10. safecat
-------------

safecat reliably writes a file into a maildir mailbox. It is
particularly useful for filing messages in procmail recipes. For
example, the following recipe files all messages in Maildir:

:0w
|safecat Maildir/tmp Maildir/new

safecat was written by Len Budney, who maintains a web page for it at
http://www.pobox.com/~lbudney/linux/software/safecat.html.

B.11. djbdns
------------

djbdns is a DNS server written by the author of qmail. It includes
tinydns, a DNS content server, and dnscache, a caching DNS server.

The official web page for djbdns is http://cr.yp.to/djbdns.html.

B.12. maildrop
--------------

maildrop is a mail filter similar to procmail.

maildrop was written by Sam Varshavchik, who maintains a web page for
it at http://www.flounder.net/~mrsam/maildrop.

B.13. syncdir
-------------

syncdir is small library that makes the link() system call
synchronous. This is necessary when using qmail with the queue on a
filesystem that doesn't perform link() synchronously, such as Linus's
ext2fs, Reiserfs, SGI's XFS, and BSD FFS with softupdates.

syncdir was written br Bruce Guenter and is available from
http://untroubled.org/syncdir/. Installation instructions are
available from
http://www.ornl.gov/its/archives/mailing-lists/qmail/2001/12/msg00949.html.

C. How Internet Mail Works
==========================

C.1. How a message gets from point A to point B
-----------------------------------------------

When a user on one host sends a message to a user on a another host,
many things happen behind the scenes that you may not be aware of.

Let's say Alice, alice@alpha.example.com, wants to send a message to
Bob, bob@beta.example.com. Here's what happens:

1. Alice composes the message with her mail user agent (MUA),
something like mutt or pine. She specifies the recipient in a To
field, the subject of the message in a Subject field, and the text of
the message itself. It looks something like:

    To: bob@beta
    Subject: lunch

    How about pizza?

2. When she's satisfied with the message, she tells the MUA to send
it.

3. At this point, the MUA can add additional header fields like Date
and Message-Id and modify the values Alice entered (e.g., replace
bob@beta with "Bob <bob@beta.example.com>". Next, the MUA injects the
message into the mail system. There are two ways to this: it can run a
program provided by the mail system for the purpose of injecting
messages, or it can open a connection to the Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) port on either the local system or a remote mail
server. For this example, we'll assume the MUA uses a local injection
program to pass messages to the MTA. The details of the injection
process vary by MTA, but on UNIX systems the sendmail method is a de
facto standard. With this method, the MUA can put the header and body
in a file, separated by a blank line, and pass the file to the
sendmail program.

4. If the injection succeeds--the message was syntactically correct
and sendmail was invoked properly--the message is now the MTA's
responsibility. Details vary greatly by MTA, but generally the MTA on
alpha examines the header to determine where to send the message,
opens an SMTP connection to beta, and forwards the message to the MTA
on the beta system. The SMTP dialogue requires messages to be sent in
two parts: the envelope, which specifies the recipient's address
(bob@beta.example.com) and the return address
(alice@alpha.example.com), and the message itself, which consists of
the header and body.

5. If the beta MTA rejects the message, perhaps because there's no
user bob on the system, the MTA on alpha sends a bounce message to the
return address, alice@alpha, to notify her of the problem.

6. If the beta MTA accepts the message, it looks at the recipient's
address, determines whether it's local to beta or on a remote system.
In this case, it's local, so the MTA either delivers the message
itself or passes it to a mail delivery agent (MDA) like /bin/mail or
procmail.

7. If the delivery fails, perhaps because Bob has exceeded his mail
quota, the beta MTA sends a bounce message to the envelope return
address, alice@alpha.

8. If the delivery succeeds, the message waits in Bob's mailbox until
his MUA reads it and displays it.

D. Architecture
===============

D.1. Modular system architecture
--------------------------------

Internet MTA's perform a variety of tasks. Earlier designs like
Sendmail and smail are monolithic. In other words, they have one
large, complex program that "switches hats": it puts on one hat to be
an SMTP server, another to be an SMTP client, another to inject
messages locally, another to manage the queue, etc.

qmail is modular. Each of these functions is performed by a separate
program. As a result, the programs are much smaller, simpler, and less
likely to contain functional or security bugs. To further enhance
security, qmail's modules run with different privileges, and they
don't "trust" each other: they don't assume the other modules always
do only what they're supposed to do.

The core modules are:

Modules                            Function
.................................. .................................. 
qmail-smtpd                        accepts/rejects messages via SMTP
qmail-inject                       injects messages locally
qmail-rspawn/qmail-remote          handles remote deliveries
qmail-lspawn/qmail-local           handles local deliveries
qmail-send                         processes the queue
qmail-clean                        cleans the queue

There's also a down side to the modular approach. Unlike a monolithic
MTA, the interactions between modules are well-defined, and modules
only exchange the minimum necessary information with each other. This
is generally A Good Thing, but sometimes it makes it hard to do
things. For example, the sendmail "-v" flag causes Sendmail to print a
trace of its actions to standard output for debugging purposes. Since
the one sendmail binary handles injection, queueing, alias processing,
.forward file processing, and remote forwarding via SMTP, it is able
to easily trace the entire delivery until the message is delivered.
The equivalent capability in qmail doesn't exist, and would require
substantial code changes and additional complexity to implement the
passing of the "debug" flag from module to module.

D.2. File structure
-------------------

/var/qmail is the root of the qmail file structure. This can be
changed when qmail is being built, but it's a good idea to leave it
unchanged so other administrators know where to find things. If you
really want to relocate some or all of the qmail tree, it's better to
do that using symbolic links. See the Create directories subsection of
the Installation section for details.

The top-level subdirectories are:

Directory                          Contents
.................................. .................................. 
alias                              .qmail files for system-wide
                                   aliases
bin                                program binaries and scripts
boot                               startup scripts
control                            configuration files
doc                                documentation (except man pages)
man                                man pages
queue                              the queue of unsent messages
users                              the qmail-users database files

D.3. Queue structure
--------------------

The file INTERNALS in the build directory discusses the details of
queueing more thoroughly. This is a broader overview of structure of
the queue.

Subdirectory                       Contents
.................................. .................................. 
bounce                             permanent delivery errors
info*                              envelope sender addresses
intd                               envelopes under construction by
                                   qmail-queue
local*                             local envelope recipient addresses
lock                               lock files
mess*                              message files
pid                                used by qmail-queue to acquire an
                                   i-node number
remote*                            remote envelope recipient
                                   addresses
todo                               complete envelopes

Note: Directories marked with an "*" contain a series of split
subdirectories named "0", "1", ..., up to (conf-split-1), where
conf-split is a compile-time configuration setting contained in the
file conf-split in the build directory. It defaults to 23. The purpose
of splitting these directories is to reduce the number of files in a
single directory on very busy servers. conf-split must be a prime
number.

Files under the mess subdirectory are named after their i-node number.
What this means is that you can't manually move them using standard
UNIX utilities like mv, dump/restore, and tar. There are a couple
user-contributed utilities on http://www.qmail.org/ that will rename
queue files correctly.

Note: It is not safe to modify queue files while qmail is running. If
you want to modify the queue, stop qmail first, play with the queue
carefully, then restart qmail.

D.4. Pictures
-------------

There is a series of files in /var/qmail/doc with names starting with
PIC. These are textual "pictures" of various situations that qmail
handles. They show the flow of control through the various modules,
and are very helpful for debugging and creating complex
configurations.

E. Infrequently Asked Questions
===============================

These are questions that don't qualify as frequently asked, but which
are important and not easy to answer.

E.1. How frequently does qmail try to send deferred messages?
-------------------------------------------------------------

Each message has its own retry schedule. The longer a message remains
undeliverable, the less frequently qmail tries to send it. The retry
schedule is not configurable. The following table shows the retry
schedule for a message that's undeliverable to a remote recipient
until it bounces. Local messages use a similar, but more frequent,
schedule.

   Delivery Attempt                    Seconds             D-HH:MM:SS

E.2. Why can't I send mail to a large site with lots of MX's?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If you're getting:

deferral: CNAME_lookup_failed_temporarily._(#4.4.3)/

The problem might be that qmail can't handle large name server query
responses. The fix is to install djbdns. See Patches under Advanced
Topics.

There's also a question as to why some people don't have trouble
reaching such systems. Basically, depending on the timing and ordering
of queries made to your local nameserver, the size of the response to
an ANY query for "aol.com" may be larger than the 512 byte limit of a
UDP packet, or it may not.

"May not" is likely to happen if the A and MX records time out, but
the NS records don't. Since the .COM servers set a 2 day TTL on those,
but AOL sets a 1 hour TTL on their records, this will often happen on
less busy nameservers. Busier nameservers are more likely to have
those records in their cache at any given time, frustrating an
unpatched qmail's attempts to check for CNAMEs.

A better test is to send mail to nosuchuser@large-mx.ckdhr.com; if it
clears your queue and winds up bouncing from ckdhr.com, your MTA can
send mail to hosts with MX lists that exceed 512 bytes. (By using a
single RRset, with a single TTL, that exceeds 512 bytes, the problem
can be seen without depending on the timing and ordering of other
queries.)

E.3. What is QUEUE_EXTRA?
-------------------------

QUEUE_EXTRA is a compile-time configuration variable that specifies an
additional recipient that will be added to every delivery. This is
used primarily for logging. E.g., the FAQ describes how to use
QUEUE_EXTRA to keep copies of all incoming and outgoing messages.

To use QUEUE_EXTRA, edit extra.h specifying the additional recipient
in the format "Trecipient\0", and the length of the QUEUE_EXTRA string
in QUEUE_EXTRALEN (the "\0" counts as one character). For example:

    #define QUEUE_EXTRA "Tlog\0"
    #define QUEUE_EXTRALEN 5

Shut down qmail if it's running. If you installed the qmailctl script
from the Installation section, that can be done by:

    qmailctl stop

If you don't have the qmailctl script, you should use your
startup/shutdown script or send qmail-send a TERM signal.

Then rebuild qmail using:

    make setup check

Populate ~alias/.qmail-log with whatever logging you want. E.g., to
log Message-ID's:

    | awk '/^$/ { exit } /^[mM][eE][sS][sS][aA][gG][eE]-/ { print }'

Finally, restart qmail.

F. Error Messages
=================

qmail error messages and what they mean.

See RFC 1893 for an explanation of the error codes in parentheses.

This appendix is incomplete.

G. Gotchas
==========

These "gotchas" frequently cause problems for qmail newbies.

G.1. qmail doesn't deliver mail to superusers.
----------------------------------------------

To prevent the possibility of qmail-local running commands as a
privileged user, qmail ignores all users whose UID is 0. This is
documented in the qmail-getpw man page.

That doesn't mean qmail won't deliver to root, it just means that such
a delivery will have to be handled by a non-privileged user.
Typically, one creates an alias for root by populating
~alias/.qmail-root.

G.2. qmail doesn't deliver mail to users who don't own their home directory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another security feature, and just good general practice. This is
documented in the qmail-getpw man page.

G.3. qmail doesn't deliver mail to users whose usernames contain uppercase letters.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

qmail converts the entire "local part"--everything left of the "@" in
an address, to lowercase. The man page doesn't come out and say that,
but the code does. The fact that it ignores users with uppercase
characters is documented in the qmail-getpw man page.

G.4. qmail replaces dots (.) in extension addresses with colons (:).
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Another security feature. The purpose is prevent extension addresses
from backing up the file tree using "..". By replacing them with
colons, qmail ensures that all .qmail files for a user are under their
home directory. Documented in the qmail-local man page.

G.5. qmail converts uppercase characters in extension addresses to lowercase.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is another result of the fact that qmail lowercases the entire
local part of addresses. Documented in the qmail-local man page.

G.6. qmail doesn't use /etc/hosts.
----------------------------------

qmail never uses /etc/hosts to determine the IP address associated
with a host name. If you use names in control files, qmail must have
access to a name server.

It is possible to run qmail on systems without access to a name
server, though. Hosts in control files can be specified by IP address
by enclosing them in square brackets ([]), e.g.:

    [10.1.2.219]

Actually, the square brackets aren't always necessary--but it's a good
idea to use them anyway.

G.7. qmail doesn't log SMTP activity.
-------------------------------------

For a number of reasons, qmail doesn't log SMTP connections,
rejections, invalid commands, or valid commands. tcpserver can be used
to log connections, and recordio can be used to log the entire SMTP
dialogue. recordio is part of the ucspi-tcp package. The procedure is
documented in the FAQ at
http://cr.yp.to/qmail/faq/servers.html#recordio.

G.8. qmail doesn't generate deferral notices.
---------------------------------------------

If Sendmail is unable to deliver a message within a few hours,
typically four, it sends a deferral notice to the originator. These
notices look like bounce messages, but don't indicate that the
delivery has failed permanently, yet.

qmail doesn't send such warnings. An undeliverable message will only
be returned to the originator after it spends queuelifetime in the
queue.

G.9. qmail is slow if /var/qmail/queue/lock/trigger is gone/has the wrong permissions/is a regular file.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

qmail-queue and qmail-send communicate via a named pipe called
/var/qmail/queue/lock/trigger. If this pipe gets messed up, qmail-send
doesn't notice new messages for a half hour or so.

The best way to ensure that it's set up right is to run "make check"
from the source directory. If that's not possible, make sure it looks
like:

# ls -l /var/qmail/queue/lock/trigger
prw--w--w-   1 qmails   qmail           0 Jul  5 21:25 /var/qmail/queue/lock/trigger

Pay particular attention to the "p" at the beginning of the line (says
it's a named pipe), the mode (especially world writable), and the
owner/group.

G.10. DNS or IDENT lookups can make SMTP slow
---------------------------------------------

If qmail-smtpd is slow to respond to connections, the problem is
probably due to DNS reverse lookups or IDENT lookups. If you're
starting qmail-smtpd with tcpserver, remove the "-h", "-p", and "-r"
options and add "-H", "-P", "-R", and "-l 0" (ell zero).

G.11. Carriage Return/Linefeed (CRLF) line breaks don't work
------------------------------------------------------------

qmail-inject and other local injection mechanisms like sendmail don't
work right when messages are injected with DOS-style carriage
return/linefeed (CRLF) line breaks. Unlike Sendmail, qmail requires
locally-injected messages to use Unix newlines (CR only). This is a
common problem with PHP scripts.

G.12. qmail-send or tcpserver stop working if logs back up
----------------------------------------------------------

If you're logging to a supervised log service, as described in section
2, and the log service fails for any reason: disk full, typo in the
run script, log directory configuration error, etc., the pipeline will
eventually fill up, causing the service to block, or hang. Fix the
problem (see Troubleshooting) and everything will return to normal.
